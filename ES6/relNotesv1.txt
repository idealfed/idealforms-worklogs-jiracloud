Release Notes:

Alterations:

managedAttachment - now allows an unnamed file by using a jirafield to store the name of the first upload

managedAttachment - list switched from html to grid

managedAttachment - added "delete:true" to allow deleting of versions

Scaling:  grid, itemlist, itemtree, attachmentlisttree:  columns support % in combination px. PX is the default for a number, when % is used the total % is
the area of the thing NOT fixed.  So your total % should add to 100.



Additions:

attachmentlisttree - probably the best interface for files.  Shows distinct files as first layer of tree with versions as children.  
Also added the concept of File Attributes.  Patterned after the GRID, you bind a FILE ATTRUBUTE custom type to this control (data source)
and it will render and collect the additional attributes for each file version.

itemlistHTML - renders an itemlist as pure HTML

itemlistGRID - renders a GRID as pure HTML

Reference Editor - provides a mechanism for editing ijf reference data
